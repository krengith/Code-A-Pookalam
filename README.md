### Pookalam Description
  I had come up with the idea for this pookalam design with the idea of it being interactive. As websites that are interactive are more fun to go through than others I decided to implement a scroll-down-to-reveal-pookalam. As this required more than just html and css coding, I reached out to chat gpt for further assistance and accomplised a immersive pookalam website!üå∏üåªüå∫ü™∑üå∑
